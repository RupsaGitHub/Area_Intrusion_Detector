# Area_Intrusion_Detector
This is an electronics hardware project that is capable of detecting itruders in a designated area
A compact and effective Area Intrusion Detection System built using an Arduino board, laser module, and LDR (Light Dependent Resistor). This system is designed to detect unauthorized movement across a secured line by monitoring the interruption of a laser beam.

ðŸ”§ How It Works
The laser beam is continuously aimed at an LDR sensor. When an object or person interrupts the beam (i.e., blocks the light reaching the LDR), the Arduino detects the change in light intensity and triggers an alarm or LED to indicate an intrusion.

>> Features
> Simple yet effective intrusion detection

> Real-time response using laser beam interruption

> Visual or audible alert system (e.g., LED, buzzer)

> Low-cost and beginner-friendly setup

> Can be scaled for larger perimeter security with multiple modules

>> Hardware Components
Arduino Uno/Nano

Laser diode module
LDR (Light Dependent Resistor)
Resistors (10kÎ© or as needed)
Buzzer or LED (for alert)
Jumper wires and breadboard
Power supply or USB cable

>> Software
Arduino IDE â€“ For uploading the sketch
Language: C++ (Arduino language)

>> Arduino Code Overview
Reads analog values from the LDR
Compares the value against a threshold
Triggers a buzzer or LED when the laser is blocked

>> Getting Started
Set up the hardware as per the circuit diagram
Upload the provided code using the Arduino IDE
Align the laser with the LDR
Test by interrupting the beam and observing the alarm
